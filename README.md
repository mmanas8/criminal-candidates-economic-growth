# criminal-candidates-economic-growth
An individual project for ECON 323 where I analyze the causal effect of electing criminal politicians on constituency-level economic growth (proxied by intensity of night-time lights). 

The project is inspired from [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304387818304619), and I used this project as an opportunity to learn Python, improve my data analysis skills and gain exposure to Regression Discontinuity designs.
